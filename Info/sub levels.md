# Sub Levels

Sub levels is how nekoBT attempts to categorize the **quality** of a release's subtitles.<br>
The higher the sub level, the better the quality of the subtitles.<br>

The sub levels are as follows:
- **Level 0 (L0)**: Official subtitles
    - These are official subtitles taken from a source.
        - Examples: Netflix, Crunchyroll, Blu-ray, etc.
    - Edits to the main style are considered as "minor changes", and would still be L0.
- **Level 1 (L1)**: Basic fansubs
    - Small changes from official sources. <!-- TODO: Define what qualifies as "small changes" -->
- **Level 2 (L2)**: Mid-tier fansubs
    - Requires two of the following: ED, TS, or Song Styling.
- **Level 3 (L3)**: High quality fansubs
    - Requires all of the following: ED, TS, Song Styling, fixed timing issues, and QC.
- **Level 4-9 (L4-L9)**: Batch releases
    - These levels are reserved for batch releases, and can only be awarded by staff.
        - To get L4+ on a release, report the torrent under the "Request Level Increase for Batch" category.
    - Must meet L3 requirements.
    - Contains batch fixes, such as typos, missing typesetting, etc.
    - A release can obtain a higher level than other batch releases by being higher quality.
        - Quality is slightly subjective, but it *usually* does not depend on the encode quality, as this is categorized by Video Type.
    - For movies, L4 is only used to mark upgrades in quality compared to other L3 releases.

!!!info Edge case:
If an episode can't have a certain job done, then you can count it as being done.<br>
Example 1: If an episode has no songs, then you can count Song Styling as being done.<br>
Example 2: If an episode has no signs, then you can count TS as being done.<br>
However, just because an episode has no songs or signs, doesn't automatically make it L2.<br>
If you have done other jobs (TLC, QC, etc), then you can make it L2.
!!!

Here's a flow chart to help you categorize your release's sub level:

### Appendix
- **ED**: Editing, making changes to the script to make it read well.
- **TS**: Typesetting, turning foreign signs (text on screen) into your language.
- **QC**: Quality Check, checking everyone's work for errors, typos, etc.
- **TLC**: Translation Check, checking the translation for accuracy.
